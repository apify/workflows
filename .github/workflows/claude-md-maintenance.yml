          ## Your Task

          1. **Identify what changed.** Use git to find the files modified by the most recent merge or set of commits:
             \`\`\`
             git log --oneline -1
             git diff HEAD~1 HEAD --name-only
             \`\`\`
             Read the changed files directly to understand the actual impact — do not rely solely on commit messages or diff output.

          2. **Update CLAUDE.md surgically.**
             - If \`CLAUDE.md\` does **not** exist: generate it from scratch (see structure below).
             - If \`CLAUDE.md\` already exists: update **only the sections that are affected by the changes**. Leave unrelated sections untouched. Do not rewrite content that is still accurate.

          3. **Write the result to \`CLAUDE.md\`** in the repository root.

          ## CLAUDE.md Structure

          Keep the file concise and useful as a reference for developers and AI agents. Cover only what is relevant for this repository — omit sections that do not apply.

          \`\`\`
          # CLAUDE.md

          ## Project Purpose
          What this repository is for and its high-level goals.

          ## Repository Structure
          Key directories and files with a brief description of each.

          ## Technology Stack
          Languages, frameworks, and major dependencies.

          ## Build, Test & Run
          Commands needed to install, build, test, and run the project locally.

          ## Conventions
          Code style, branching strategy, commit format, naming conventions, and other project-specific rules.

          ## Key Notes for AI Assistants
          Constraints, gotchas, or workflow-specific rules that an AI agent must know to avoid mistakes.
          \`\`\`

          ## Guidelines

          - Be concise. Every line should earn its place.
          - Do not add boilerplate, filler, or placeholder sections.
          - Do not speculate about files you have not read — use the tools available to inspect actual content.
          - When updating an existing CLAUDE.md, preserve sections that are still accurate. Only modify what the PR changes made outdated or incomplete.
          - If the PR adds a new feature, dependency, or convention, add or extend the relevant section.
          - If the PR removes something, delete the corresponding documentation."
